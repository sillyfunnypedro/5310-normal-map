# Description

You have learned that we can draw polygons to the screen by plotting them out one triangle at a time both in a software render and in WebGL. We can even use mathematical functions to draw nice curves and geometric patterns (e.g. the [sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)) to draw more interesting graphical scenes.  Most often however complex shapes will either be modeled in 3D by artists [[Breaking into the Game Industry: 3D Character Art
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaPkbl5n7Pc)] [[Meet Anshelle â€“ 3D Artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=funtOiN3gKY)] or otherwise scanned from the real world by [lasers to capture the geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lDO1UevAJI) of an object. This data is then output in a 3D file format that can be read in by the CPU and then drawn to the screen using our GPUs.

One of the more famous 3D models is the [Stanford Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny). This bunny was a scan of a ceramic figurine (don't worry--no bunnies were harmed!) by a laser at Stanford University in 1994. Other common models that are used in computer graphics are the [Stanford Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_dragon), the [Utah teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot), or [Suzanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#Suzanne).

## Part 1 - Render a model

### Task 0: Install http-server on your machine
Running WebGL means that we are not allowed to read files from the local machine.   Typically web applications need to be able to source their data from a data store.  In this particular course we do not want to rely on files that might be on other machines so we will start our own server on our machine.  Complete details (and the source code for the server) can be found [here](https://github.com/http-party/http-server).

I have shamelessly copied the instalation instructions from the project's home page. 

#### Running on-demand:
Using npx you can run the script without installing it first:

npx http-server [path] [options]
#### Globally via npm
npm install --global http-server
This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line anywhere.

#### Globally via Homebrew

brew install http-server
As a dependency in your npm package:
npm install http-server
<img align="right" src="./media/server-running.jpg" alt="Stanford Bunny" width="400px"/>

Once you have done this navigate to the root directory of the 5310Resources project and then run http-server in that directory.
```bash
http-server -c-i --cors
```

you can see if the server is running by opening a browser on your machine and going to http://localhost:8080

You should see something like this 
The files will be potentially different, but what you see should match what is in the root directory of the ResourcesDirectory
In my sample code i will be assuming that you have a http-server running from that directory.   If you run your server in a different place you will have to adjust the paths to your files accordingly.



### Task 1 - Model Loading

Here are some .obj files that are kicking around the internet.
|link | description|
|----|----|
|[The bunny](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/Data/Meshes/bunny.obj)| The stanford bunny.   This is a pretty standard model that is used by computer graphics researchers and students. |
|[The teapot](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/as3/code/as3/teapot.obj)| This is the original teapot that has grown up with the computer graphics industry|




For this assignment you are going to render a 3D model in the [wavefront .obj format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). Some sample models are provided in: [http://localhost:8080/objects/](http://localhost:8080/objects/)

The tasks for rendering in this assignment are the following:

1. Fetch the .obj file from a URL
1. Parse the file into a set of triangles
1. Make sure you can parse the .obj file format (i.e. read in the vertices and faces). This is your geometry data.
	- I recommend you build a custom class (e.g. OBJ) for this task. 
1. Cache the geometry data in your web_browser local storage.
1. Utilize the vertex buffers (we looked at them last assignment) to correctly display the triangles for the object.
1. Be able to display either of the objects on the screen based on the front end buttons.

### OBJ Format

The models that you will be loading are in the [.obj format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). This format stores the vertices, normals, and faces of an object (and potentially other information as well). The easiest way to become familiar with the OBJ file format is to investigate a 3D Cube model. Here is a cube exported in the .obj file format from the free tool [Blender3D](https://www.blender.org/).

### Parsing the file

(For this assignment, ignore the .mtl materials files)
```
mtllib cube.mtl

```

For this file, the encoding is the following:
* Lines that start with *v* stands for a 'vertex'.
	* A vertex has an x,y,z coordinate that follows.
* Lines that start with *vn* stands for a 'vertex normal'.
	* A vertex normal is a normalized directional vector(from 0,0,0 to its location)
* Lines that start with *f* stands for 'face'.
	* A face can consist of any number of vertices. 
	* The first number is the index of the vertex we are using. 
	* The second number after the double slashes (//) is the vertex normal index.
* The other fields (that start with o, s, or the .mtl file) can be ignored for this assignment.
* Note that there are no '0' values in the list. This means .obj is 1's based. In most languages we count from 0, so think about what this means when parsing!

### Task 2 - Parametrized display

For task 2, we are going to utilize SDL to make our graphics application interactive. 

The tasks for interactivity in this assignment are the following:
- Pressing the <kbd>w</kbd> key draws your object in wireframe mode (By default when you start the application it will show the model in filled).
- Pressing the <kbd>q</kbd> key exits the application.
- Pressing the <kbd>1</kbd> key renders a .obj model read in from the command-line
- (Optional) Pressing the <kbd>2</kbd> - <kbd>9</kbd> key renders any other objects that have been read in from the command-line.
	- e.g. (./lab "./../../common/objects/bunny_centered.obj" "./../../common/objects/capsule/capsule.obj")
		- Pressing 1 would render the bunny, and a 2 would render the capsule.

A resource for performing [keyboard input with SDL is provided here](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/04_key_presses/index.php)

### Assignment strategy

My suggested strategy for this project is:

* You can use any of the code from the labs that you may find useful.
	* In fact, I highly recommend it!
* Have a C++ class (in a .hpp and .cpp file) for loading OBJ models--not doing so is bad style!
	* For example, `class OBJModel` would be an ideal name for handling the loading and rendering of an OBJ model.
	* Utilize within the class a STL data structure (e.g. std::vector, std::array, etc.)
  	* You may assume all faces are triangles (though if you download additional test .obj files from the web this may not be the case)
* Think about how you can load a line of text and then split it into individual tokens.
  	* A resource loading files (Filo I/O) in C++ can be found here: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
  	* The reference on strings may be useful: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/
    		* Some ideas on string splitting: http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/how-to-split-a-string-in-c.html
* You do not need to use any complex glsl fragment or vertex shaders. In fact, I recommend using the most basic ones for this assignment.
* I recommend using the [docs.gl](http://docs.gl/gl3/glPolygonMode) webpage for help with OpenGL. 
* Note, that we have not yet learned about cameras, so when you begin rendering, you may be inside the object--consider that when you are rendering (in the case of the cube for example, you will see an 'X' in your display). You can 'translate' the model if need be to adjust its position.

#### Debugging

If you don't see a 3D model appearing on your screen after your attempt, here are some tips:

1. Try rendering in wire frame mode first to see if anything shows up (A quick google of 'how do I render wireframe in OpenGL' will show you how to do this) 
2. Try loading a few different models (of different sizes) to see if your .obj loader works.
3. Ensure that you are loading your buffers with the correct number of vertices and indices (i.e. A common mistake I see is the improper use of 'sizeof' which returns the data type size, not the actual number of elements in a collection. See std::vector.size() for example)
4. Try to write a 'print()' function to display all the vertices and indices.
	- The vertices and indices printed out should match the data you are parsing.
6. If your bunny looks 'almost right', but a little bit scrambled -- Careful also with 'off by 1 errors'
	- Remember, the face list in the .obj uses a 1-based index, whereas we as C++ programmers are used to a 0-based index.
	- Thus, you have to 'subtract 1' from the index when parsing the .obj file and storing the data on your CPU.
7. Sometimes folks mix up GL_ARRAY_BUFFER and GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER for where the vertices (the former), and indices (the latter GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER) should be used.
8. I often see folks do this in their code `float verts[some_vector.size()]` 
	- This is dangerous, as if some_vector.size() is a really big value, 'verts' which is a local variable (which is an array), and 'verts' is thus located on the stack which has a small amount of memory that may not be able to allocate for very large objects.

## How to compile and run your program

1. Your solution should compile using the [build.py](./build.py) file. 
	- That is, we will run your program by typing [python3 build.py](./build.py) and it should just work.
2. After compiling your code, we will run the executable with an argument to a .obj model.

# Submission/Deliverables

### Submission

- Commit all of your files to github, including any additional files you create.
- Do not commit any binary files unless told to do so.
- Do not commit any 'data' files generated when executing a binary.

### Deliverables

- You should be able to load and display a bunny_centered.obj and monkey_centered.obj at the least
	- The ./common/objects directory in your repository has some sample models.
	- You can substitute these models with other .obj's you find if you like.
- Your solution should be interactive, and utilize the keypresses as described in Part 1 Task 2

* You need to commit your code to this repository.
* You need to use the build.py script provided. Anything else used is at your own risk--and you should provide complete documentation. If your program does not compile and run, you get a zero!


# F.A.Q. (Instructor Anticipated Questions)

* Q: Why the obj format?
  * A: It is a standard data format understood by most programs.
  * Here's a copy of the spec if you want to read more: http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/3d/OBJ.spec
* Q: Can I load my own models that I have made to show off?
  * A: Sure -- just make sure they are added to the repository.
* Q: May I use the command line arguments to pass in a default model?
  * A: Sure -- please document at the top of your readme.md file so I am aware of this feature.
* Q: Will I lose points if I keep creating the same vertex buffer in a loop?
  * A: Yes, because you only need to allocate memory on the GPU once. Doing so many times is wasteful, and it will slow down your program by having to make the CPU and GPU communicate over and over again. Vertex Buffer Objects need only be recreated if the geometry changes.
* Q: Are the vertex normals always the same as the vertex number?
  * A: Nope! And we'll want to make sure the store those vertex normals in a separate array. It just happens to be that for models like the cube, all of the normals would be unique, because the shared vertex normal is pointing in a different direction. 
 	 * Note: We could compute the normals by hand: https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Calculating_a_Surface_Normal
 	 * Note: We could compute the normals using a 'weight' based on the area of the triangle: https://www.cat.nyu.edu/~perlin/courses/spring2012/computing-normals.html 
* Q: I heard a cube with only 8 normals is weird?
	* A: Yeah they could be a weird case if you want to do a flat shaded rendering properly. The smooth shader version can look spherical depending on the lighting. You would instead have to have unique vertices at each of the edges and uniquely generate each of the normals to use depending on which direction the face is. This explains it somewhat: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5046579/vertex-normals-for-a-cube
* Q: My program is segfaulting everytime I call an OpenGL function (e.g. glGenVertexArrays)
* A: You probably have not initialized OpenGL using glad and SDL2 to get a context. Calls to OpenGL functions will otherwise cause a 'bad excess error' or something equivalent and your program will terminate.

# Found a bug?

If you found a mistake (big or small, including spelling mistakes) in this lab, kindly send me an e-mail. It is not seen as nitpicky, but appreciated! (Or rather, future generations of students will appreciate it!)

- Fun fact: The famous computer scientist Donald Knuth would pay folks one $2.56 for errors in his published works. [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)]
- Unfortunately, there is no monetary reward in this course :)
